        <p>Lord Ganesh is my super hero , being an hindu from a country like India I have grown with Ganesha blessings. 
            The large elephant head of Lord Ganesha symbolizes wisdom, understanding, and a discriminating intellect that one must possess to attain perfection in life.
            The wide mouth represents the natural human desire to enjoy life in the world.
