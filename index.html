    <h3>Maryville</h3>
       
    <p>Maryville , For a person like me who came directly from india to Maryville will definitely like the place and culture here. <b> The Roads, buildings here in Maryville are completely different from what i have seen before. </b>
      Maryville being a small village has the beautiful locations nearby , the outskirts of village is entirely covered with vegetation. 
    <b> Iam personally having a positive vibe staying in Maryville.</b> </p>

    <h3>Algorithm - Ternary Search</h3>

    <blockquote>
        Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that can be used to find an element in an array. 
        It is similar to binary search where we divide the array into two parts but in this algorithm, we divide the given array into three parts and determine which has the key (searched element).
        We can divide the array into three parts by taking mid1 and mid2 which can be calculated as shown below. Initially, l and r will be equal to 0 and n-1 respectively, where n is the length of the array.
